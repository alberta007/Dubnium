## Introduction

Dr. Preference is an app written in Flutter and Dart. It's an app where you can enter your food preferences or allergies and by scanning a barcode you can easily see what you can eat. You can add friends and show their preferences and create members with their preferences who doesn't have the app. These friends and members you can either set to be active or inactive for easy meal planning. The active members and friends food preferences will then be active when you scan the food products and you see what food fits for everyone.
